# Contributing

We would love to accept your contributions! Before we can accept them, we have
to jump a couple of legal hurdles. Please sign one of the contributor license
agreements below.

Fork the repo, develop and test your code changes.

Submit a pull request and the repo owner will review your request. If it is
approved, the change will be merged. If it needs additional work, the repo
owner will respond with useful comments.

## Contributor License Agreements

Before creating a pull request, please fill out either the individual or
corporate Contributor License Agreement.

* If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you
own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an
[individual CLA][indv-cla].
* If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work
to this client library, then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA][corp-cla].

Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and
instructions for how to sign and return it. Once we receive it, we'll add you
to the official list of contributors and be able to accept your patches.
