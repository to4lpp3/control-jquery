## Nest Control sample app with jQuery

A simple thermostat control application that demonstrates how to access the Nest API from a web
application.

## Requirements
The development environment is a simple Node.js server managed by Yeoman. If you don't have them already
install these tools first:

* [Node](http://nodejs.org/download/)
* [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/gettingstarted.html)

## Prerequisite
In order to run this example you must first create a client in the Nest Developer portal (https://developer.nest.com/clients).  The client should be created with the following required attributes:

OAuth Redirect URI:  http://localhost:8080/auth/nest/callback
Permissions:  Thermostat read/write

All other attributes values are not specific and can be determined by the developer.

## Running
To install required Bower components and Node modules, simply type:

    $ bower install
    $ npm install

Next you will need your client ID and client secret from developer.nest.com/clients set as environment variables:

    $ export NEST_ID=<CLIENT ID>
    $ export NEST_SECRET=<CLIENT SECRET>

And finally, use Grunt to start the server:

    $ grunt

Then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser and you will be walked through the authentication process.
